         long-vignette).
       - Addedd loadBalance as an argument to the pSegment and pChromPlot
         functions, so that the user can choose to use load balancing-like
         with both forking and MPI. See additional benchmarking vignette

	 exercise this.

Changes in version 2.3.2 (2013-10-22)
       - Import aCGH and snapCGH again. Corresponding changes in Author,

	 those packages is not here.

Changes in version 2.3.1 (2013-10-20)
       - Added aCGH and snapCGH code: new R and C files, with minor
         modifications and updates (registration of routines, no partial
	 matching of arguments, etc)
       - NAMESPACE and Description reflect no longer dependency on snapCGH
         or aCGH.
       - This version works, passes tests, is checked to give the same
         results as previous ones, etc. But never made it into BioC repos,
	 as on 2013-10-23 I realized aCGH and snapCGH were again in BioC
	 devel. 

Changes in version 2.3.0 (2013-10-20)
       - Version bump for new BioC devel.

Changes in version 2.1.7 (2013-10-09)

       - changed "cores" to "mc.cores" in cutFile, for consistency. 


Changes in version 2.1.6 (2013-09-23)
       - Started testing against R beta 3.0.2. Fixed Imports and Depends.
       - chromData: using "short", not "ushort", to catch more user errors.
       - pSegmentGLAD: using a custom daglad that minimizes unneeded
         calls, specially sorting, that can be very expensive.
       - Added "certain_noNA" as an option of segmentation methods.
       - Started testing against R-devel (to become R-3.1.0).


Changes in version 2.1.5 (2013-09-16)
       - Fixed typos.
       - Minimized usage of ":::", removed unused functions for Ansari,
       and some assignemts that no longer made sense (all packages now

       - Minimize "Depends" and use "Suggests" and "Imports" in
       DESCRIPTION with "importFrom" in NAMESPACE.
       - No longer using our own mergeLevels, since identical to the ones
       in aCGH package.
       - GLAD uses now the recommended fastest option (smoothfunc=haarseg).

       - Fixed missing entry in bib of vignette.

       ff objects inside functions.
