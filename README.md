ADaCGH2
=======

Code for the [BioConductor](http://www.bioconductor.org) package
[ADaCGH2](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/ADaCGH2.html).


Licenses and copyright
======================

GPLv3 license.

All code is copyright their respective authors. Authors: Ramon
Diaz-Uriarte and Oscar M. Rueda for the main ADaCGH2 code. Wavelet-based
aCGH smoothing code from Li Hsu and Douglas Grove. Imagemap code from
Barry Rowlingson. HaarSeg code from Erez Ben-Yaacov; downloaded from
<http://www.ee.technion.ac.il/people/YoninaEldar/Info/software/HaarSeg.htm>.


Paper
=====

This package has been described in the Bioinformatics paper
[ADaCGH2: parallelized analysis of (big) CNA data]
(http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/12/1759.long). 


Other versions and repos and repo history
=========================================

Some of this code is used in other repos, such as
[adacgh-server](https://github.com/rdiaz02/adacgh-server) and
[adacgh-web](https://github.com/rdiaz02/adacgh-web). However, this is the
repo that contains the most recent version of the code as available from
BioConductor. Since all of the history is shared with, specially,
[adacgh-web](https://github.com/rdiaz02/adacgh-web), and the repo was a
mess, I have started the repo from v.2.11.0 of BioConductor.
